## Overview
### Description
Managing money is vital to sustaining one's livelihood. Using this app makes tracking daily transactions and ensuring that you are staying within your budget easier than ever!

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Financial Independence 
- **Mobile:** This app focuses on targeting individuals that need easy access to their daily spending and want to calculate their budget for different aspects of their life (entertainment, car payments, etc).
- **Story:** Gather user financial spending and generate recommendations based on user settings and user data.
- **Market:** Any individual can use this app to help with their financial journey, but individuals seeking to make changes to their financial wellness would benefit the most.
- **Habit:** Every instance an individual earns or spends money presents an opporunity for the user to enter the information into the app. This information can then be used to reevaluate the amount the user can afford to pay for rent and/or car payments. The user can open the app and use it several times a day.
- **Scope:** Our app will get transaction information from the user, use some API's, and display the most relevant data for the user - that being the transaction history and potential/desired rent and car payments.
